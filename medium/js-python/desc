JS Boo, Python Love!

You have a source file in JavaScript, but you hate JavaScript! So, you will use the power of Vim to quickly convert the file to Python.

You are guaranteed that the source file only contains some or all of the following:

1. variable definition using var, const or let (no kind of destructuring, only one variable definition per statement)
2. named function definitions (with or without arguments)
3. if-else/if-else blocks
4. standard arithmetic operations\
5. console.log for output
6. Arbitrarily many nested statements.

You are also guaranteed that all valid statements in the file end with semicolons.

Note: Whitespace matters. See input and output files for clarity.

(There are no private tests)
